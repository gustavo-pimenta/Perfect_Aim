Perfect Aim is a hack tool for FPS games.
You can stabilize your aim controlling tha recoil and the fire rate.

The first version uses this libs:
Pynput - Mouse events listener and automation control
PySimpleGUI - User interface

But this first version can't control the mouse inside games because of DirectX.
Automation libs as Pynput and PyAutoGUI send commands as VK (virtual keys). 
New games ignore VK commands to avoid bots, they just accept DirectInput commands.
